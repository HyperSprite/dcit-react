# dcit-react
----

The hope for this project is to rebuild the font end of DCIT with React and Redux.

I am taking inspiration from this blogpost [here](http://swizec.com/blog/using-react-in-the-real-world/swizec/6710)

The gist is that Swizec needed a way to integrate a dynamic chart into an existing site. So he built React component and wraps it up as a jQuery plugin so it can be inserted into the site anywhere it needs to be.

The original goal of DCIT was make it work because I had a tight deadline.

My hope is to start replacing parts of DCIT front end which is templated with handlbars and uses some jQuery for dynamics.
The main issue at this point is I still have more features to add and I don't want to keep writing it the old way. I also want to start doing things without as many page reloads.
